# ZoomerFitApp

**Description**

Due to COVID-19, gyms all over the world have been shut down and people have been forced to figure out their own methods of staying fit while stuck in their homes. Social media sites, such as Instagram, have been flooded with fitness influencers posting their own at-home workouts for their followers to attempt. Though this is a good bandage solution to the current issue, there needs to be a more organized way for people to reach/maintain their fitness goals. This is why we want to create an app acting as a database where influencers can post their workouts and followers can find workouts tailored to their goals and fitness levels.
